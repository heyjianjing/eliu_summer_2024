Mini-course for Elizabeth Liu, Summer 2024

From linear regression to Bayesian kernel regression 

* Gradient descent
* Taylor approximation
* Laplace approximation
* Metropolis sampling
* Bayesian marginalization
* Monte Carlo integration
* Radial basis function (RBF kernel)
* Virtual sample via eigendecomposition
* Bayesian optimization

Focus on `weight-space` view, so ideas in Bayesian linear regression can be retained for nonlinear case
Focus on `numerical` solutions to the extent possible
